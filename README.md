AABS (Application Additional Binary Storage) - Complete Guide Welcome to AABS! This guide explains in detail the structure, functionality, and rules for correctly using the Application Additional Binary Storage (AABS). AABS is an advanced format, similar to OBB, but much more evolved, offering support for additional application loading and seamless integration with different languages and binaries. It operates alongside a focus application, ensuring optimized management of additional data. --- 1. AABS Folder Structure (`example/`) Inside the `example/` folder, you will find **three compressed files** simulating the `.aabs` format. Currently, the `.aabs` format is not widely known, but in the future, there may be **specific libraries** to facilitate the creation of `.aabs` files and their **mandatory core**, the `.ark`. What is `.ark`? The `.ark` (Additional Resource Kernel) is the **heart of the AABS kernel**. It contains all necessary files for loading and running the AABS system. Without this file, AABS **cannot be initialized correctly**. Basic AABS structure: 

example/ │── aabs_project1.aabs # Functional AABS simulation │── aabs_project2.aabs # Another AABS structure simulation │── aabs_project3.aabs # Example with 'additional' folder │── guide.txt # This reference guide │── readme.txt # General information about AABS │── documents/ # Detailed documentation └── LICENSE # Apache 2.0 license with AABS rules

Inside an **AABS file (`.aabs`)**, the organization follows this model: 

aabs_project1.aabs/ │── kernel/ # Contains .ark and essential core files │── coreloader/ # Scripts that load the AABS kernel │── binary/ # Binary code (executables and non-executables) │── configs/ # .ini files for system configurations │── libs/ # Required libraries │── modules/ # Additional modules │── share/ # Files for app communication │── feedback/ # Logs and execution information (if generated) └── additional/ # (Optional) Extra support files

--- 2. Detailed Explanation of AABS Folders **2.1. `kernel/` (The Core of AABS)** The `kernel/` folder contains the `.ark` file, which is essential for AABS operation. - **`kernel.ark`**: This is the **core** of AABS, a compressed file containing **all necessary scripts** and **binaries** for system execution. - Inside `.ark`, there are **various binary files**, **scripts from multiple languages**, and essential elements for AABS loading. - If this file is missing or corrupted, **AABS will not function**. **2.2. `coreloader/` (Kernel Loader)** This folder contains scripts responsible for **loading and initializing the kernel** properly. - Without `coreloader/` files, the **kernel.ark will not be activated**, preventing AABS execution. **2.3. `binary/` (Binary Code)** This folder contains all **binary code** needed for AABS operation and interaction with the focus application. - Only **executable and non-executable binary files** (e.g., `.bin`, `.dll`) are allowed. - Unlike the `kernel/` folder, this one contains only **direct binary files**, without source scripts. **2.4. `configs/` (System Configuration Files)** The `configs/` folder contains **.ini files**, responsible for defining **specific actions and behaviors within AABS**. - Each configuration file follows a structured format, ensuring **proper system execution**. **2.5. `libs/` (Libraries)** The `libs/` folder contains **all libraries used by AABS**. - It should not contain **additional modules** (they belong in `modules/`). - This section stores **essential libraries**, properly organized by language. **2.6. `modules/` (Additional Modules)** Modules that **can be added directly to AABS** are stored here. - This allows **new features to be implemented** without modifying the core (`kernel/`). **2.7. `share/` (Interaction with Other Applications)** This folder stores **files responsible for communication** between AABS and other applications. - Unlike `libs/`, this section **does not contain libraries**, only **direct scripts** for interaction. --- 3. Special Folders in AABS **3.1. `additional/` (Support Extension) – Optional** The `additional/` folder is **optional**, but can be very useful for storing **additional extensions**. - Supports **.dll, .ini, .config, .bin, .bat, and even executable applications**. - Useful for extending AABS functionality without modifying the core (`kernel/`). **3.2. `feedback/` (Logs and Reports)** This folder **is only generated when AABS is successfully initialized** and contains **execution details**. - **`logs.log`** → Stores **up to 100 lines** of logs, removing older entries when exceeding the limit. - **`kernel_logs.log`** → Stores **all interactions** of the kernel during execution. - **`status.log`** → Records the **general status of AABS execution**, useful for debugging. If AABS **fails to start**, this folder **will not be created**, indicating something went wrong. --- 4. How to Properly Create an AABS? 1. **Set up the directory structure according to this guide.** 2. **Ensure that the `kernel.ark` file is inside the `kernel/` folder.** 3. **Place binary files in the appropriate folders (`binary/`, `libs/`, `modules/`).** 4. **Store configuration settings inside the `configs/` folder in `.ini` format.** 5. **If needed, extend functionalities using the `additional/` folder.** 6. **Make sure the `coreloader/` contains the correct scripts to load `kernel.ark`.** 7. **Run and check if the `feedback/` folder is generated to confirm successful initialization.** --- 5. Conclusion AABS is an **advanced additional binary storage system**, designed to efficiently interact with applications without compromising their main structure. - The **`.ark`** file is the **essential core**, without which the system **cannot function**. - The structure **must be well-organized, keeping languages and libraries separate**. - The **`feedback/` folder serves as a clear indicator of success**: if generated, it confirms that AABS, `.ark`, and the focus application are working correctly. In the future, **dedicated tools** may emerge to facilitate the creation and management of `.aabs` and `.ark` files.
